        <h2>Siberian Kittens - Siberian kitten </h2>
        
        <p>MUNCHKIN CAT:
            We, have devoted our love and energy to increasing the quality of life and health of our munchkin cats and munchkin kittens. We maintain very strict requirements pertaining to the breeding, raising, and caring of our munchkin kittens for sale.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Multiple studies have shown neutering sharply reduces Fel-d1 levels and allergic reactions. The allergen is hormonally controlled, and non-neutered males produce the highest levels. After neutering, allergen levels drop sharply in both males and females. We recommend early neutering with your Veterinarian’s advice in households with cat allergies. Many years ago Croshka Munchkin Kittens started taking samples of saliva for testing Fel-d1 allergen levels from our adult breeding Munchkin cCats. These samples were sent to Indoor Biotechnologies, which specializes in measuring Fel-d1 allergens. Much to our pleasant surprise, a large majority of my cat line showed very low allergen levels!!!! The sex or color of the cat didn’t seem to matter with these cats tested. Since the testing, we have found the unscientific method of witnessing all of the families living with Munchkins Kittens .This test has been the best test around!!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Munchkin KITTEN APPEARANCE
                The Munchkin cat is a medium to large cat with the overall appearance of excellent physical condition, strength, balance, power, and alertness, modified by a sweet facial expression. Sibeiran Kittens can come in a rainbow of Russian colors since they are a natural breed. Female cats can average 8-13 lbs, while males average 10-18 lbs, with some being larger. Males do become much more muscular than females. Munchkin Forest Cat are slow to mature and take up to five years to fully develop. Their eyes vary in color from gold to green and all shades in between and colorpoints will always have blue eyes. Munchkins are a natural breed and reflect the climate in which they developed, with their very dense, medium to long, water repellent triple coat. This coat is accented with a ruff around the neck, full fluffy britches, and a bushy tail, normally carried up with pride. Lynx tipping on the ear is allowed, and full ear furnishings are required. This means that the tops of the ears can have hair, which makes the ears look pointed when in fact they are rounded, and that the inside of the ear has hair that protects it from the elements.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Male vs. Female Behavior Findings:</h4>
                In the book “The Cat’s Mind” by Dr. Bruce Fogle, a survey had been done with over 100 small animal Veterinarians. He was trying to determine the different behavior in males and females and neutered male and female cats. This was a “forced evaluation” survey.
                
                The survey determined that NEUTERED MALES AND FEMALES SHOWED MINIMAL DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOR. Neutered males are very slightly friendlier to other household cats and are slightly easier to handle and give a little more affection than females. There is no difference in their demand for attention, hygiene, level of activity, destructiveness, use of voice, excitability or playfulness. Both male and female cats can spray when not spayed or neutered.
                
                Whereas the difference in behavior between male and female dogs are still major differences after neutering, this is not true with cats. There is some evidence that as far as friendliness to other cats, handling and giving affection, NEUTERED MALES ACTUALLY MAKE EASIER PETS THAN Spayed FEMALES.
                
                Size Issue: Female cats average 8-13 lbs, males average 10-18 lbs, with some being larger. Males do become much more muscular than females. Munchkins are slow to mature and take up to five years to fully develop.
                <h4>Munchkin CAT PERSONALITY:</h4>
                The Munchkins have a wonderful dog like purrrrrrrsonality and they are very affectionate and ca even leare ad love to play fetch!!! Unlike many breeds, this breed will come over and greet a stranger. They are very intelligent and learn quickly and even “problem-solve” to get what they want. They love to be spoken to and will come running if called by name. Munchkins also have a triple purr and unlike other breeds have a chirping sound when coming up to greet you. They also have a large bushy tail that stands at attention and does a shimmering effect when happy. Munchkins have a fascination with water, often dropping toys into their water dishes or investigating bathtubs before they dry. This is the ideal lap cat that is calm and yet very active at playtime.
