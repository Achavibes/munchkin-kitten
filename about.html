            <h2>Munchkin Kittens for sale - About Our Cattery</h2>     
            <P>Munkin Kitty Farm is a TICA-registered cattery located at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Our specialties include Munchkin Kittens For Sale. My wife and I bought our Munchkin Kitten and Scottish Fold Munchkin Kittens (called Lucas and Jayla) in 2009, and we started breeding them right away. After all these years, we're still interested by the breed. All of our Munchkin Kittens and Scottish Fold Munchkin Kittens are grown indoors, and we're here to ensure that the new owners of our Munchkin Kittens and Scottish Fold Munchkin Kittens receive the best possible care. We've worked hard since our beginnings to make the process of buying a home as simple as possible.

<h3>MUNCHKIN KITTEN VACCINATION</h3>
<p>Munchkin Kittens For Sale are cared for as if they were members of the family. They live with us at our house. Every day, all of our kittens interact freely with the rest of the family. They are free to run, jump, and play. We designed a kitten-proof playroom to ensure their safety. As breeders, our goal is to create the healthiest and sweetest kittens possible so that you and your family may experience the cuteness overload that comes with having the sweetest kitten.

Our Munchkin Kittens For Sale and Scottish Fold Munchkins For Sale are carefully monitored for any common breed-related illnesses, and all of our kittens are current on all vaccinations and come with a one-year health guarantee. We also offer lifetime assistance to our customers.</P>

<h3>MUNCHKIN KITTEN GROOMING.</h3>
<p>Ross Williams discovered the first Scottish Fold Cat on a farm near Coupar Angus, northwest of Dundee, in the Tayside Region of Scotland. He approached the owners and asked if he could take one of the kittens, and from Susie, a white barn cat, he developed the breed.

    This cat's ears were folded forward and downward on her head, which was a distinguishing trait. The kitten resembled a "pixie," "owl," or "teddy bear" as a result. This breed has captured the hearts of many Americans, as well as people all across the world. Scottish Folds come in two varieties: folded ears and straight ears. The ears become droopy due to an incomplete dominant gene, which is caused by an incomplete dominant gene.</p>
<h3>OUR MUNCHKIN CAT ADOPTION.</h3>
<p>Prepare your home for hypoallergenic cats. Purchase a scratching post, litter box, food and water bowls, and cat bed before bringing your cat home. Make sure the litter box is placed in a quiet, low-traffic area - such as a pantry, guest bathroom or other out-of-the-way corner - where the hypoallergenic cat can defecate in peace. Buy a large Munchkin cat carrier, as our Munchkin cat for sale can get quite large. It is okay if the carrier seems too large at first; the cat will get used to it. When you bring the hypoallergenic cat home, place the carrier in a room, open the door of the Munchkin cat carrier and close the door to the room. Let the cat explore the room at its leisure.

    Give the Munchkin cat room to explore. Our Munchkin cats for sale have a high energy level and like to roam. Most prefer to have access to the outdoors. If kept indoors, they should have at least one large apartment to explore. Hypoallergenic apartment cats for sale are at risk for obesity due to their lower activity levels, so watch their food intake carefully. Outdoor cats are at increased risk of injury and illness. Therefore, do not allow them to roam freely in areas where they may come into contact with heavy vehicle traffic, wild animals, or pesticides and other chemicals.
    
    Munchkin kittens are strong jumpers and like to explore high places. They are nimble cats and don't tend to break things, but you may want to consider keeping valuable or expensive items out of their reach.
    
    Provide entertainment. Our Munchkin cats for sale are intelligent and need stimulation. Bored Munchkin cats can overeat, scratch at furniture, and here are some ways to prevent boredom: Buy a ceiling-high "tree" that Munchkin kittens for sale can jump up to inspect their territory. Give Munchkin kittens cat toys and puzzles. Experiment with yarn, toy mice, laser pointers and catnip. Many Munchkin cats enjoy playing fetch. Encourage it with treats or dry food as rewards.
    
    A second Munchkin cat often makes the first cat feel less lonely, especially if they are littermates. Make sure the cats are spayed or neutered unless you want to mess with kittens; this is especially important if you have a male and female Munchkin kitten together, but outdoor cats may also encounter cats of the opposite sex in your neighborhood How to keep your cat healthy Maintain your cat's coat.
    
    Although Munchkin cats have thick coats, grooming is easier than with most long-haired cats. Munchkin cats' coats don't tend to mat too quickly, so grooming them once or twice a week is enough to keep them healthy. Brush gently with a soft, smooth brush. Munchkins molt twice a year and shed their fur in large clumps. During this time, daily brushing is the easiest way to keep the coat from matting and tangling. Brushing reduces the likelihood of hairballs. Protect the cat from heat. Do not keep Munchkin cats in temperatures above 33ºC (91ºF). They are adapted to cold climates, and they can overheat easily in their thick coats. Take the following precautions during summer months: Put ice in the cat's food or water. At the very least, use cold water instead of warm or room-temperature water. Take the cat to a professional groomer and have her shave away most of the fur. The fur will grow back by the winter, but it may make your cat much more comfortable through the summer months. Visit a veterinarian if your cat seems uncomfortable. You may notice it going to great lengths to keep cool, such as rubbing against the refrigerator or spending time in cold spaces. If the cat makes painful yowling noises, and it doesn't seem particularly hungry, it might be uncomfortable. Bathe the cat occasionally. Munchkin cats have a water-resistant, triple-layered coat. Many of them enjoy water and may try to jump into the bath or shower.
    
    Even if your cat doesn't like water, give him a bath whenever his coat gets dirty. Bathing can also reduce allergens if someone in the house is allergic to cats. If necessary, use a mild cat shampoo and conditioner made with oatmeal. Your Munchkin cat has a fairly oily coat, which keeps the skin healthy and regulates the cat's temperature. Bathing too often can remove these protective oils. Because of the thick coat, it can take up to 45 minutes for your cat's fur to get completely wet. Check your cat's health weekly.
    
    If you have a kitten, start early with these grooming routines so she can get used to them. If you have difficulty with these procedures, ask a veterinarian to show you how to do them: Trim the nails once a week or as needed. Use scissors to trim the nails. Check your cat's ears about once a week. If they appear dirty, clean them with a cotton swab moistened with a mild cat ear cleaner recommended by your veterinarian. If the ears are red or smell bad, take your cat to the veterinarian.
    
    Brush your cat's teeth regularly with a veterinarian-recommended toothpaste to ensure good health and fresh breath. Munchkin cats can pick up ticks or fleas quite easily. Check outdoor cats regularly and remove ticks and fleas if found. Schedule regular veterinary checkups. Munchkin cats are prone to stomach problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome or lymphoma.
    
    Visit the veterinarian regularly to keep an eye on their stomach. Munchkins are also prone to at least one hereditary health problem: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Munchkins to be bred should be screened for HCM, and cats identified with HCM should be removed from breeding programs. Do not purchase kittens whose parents have not been tested for this disease. Feed cats high-quality food. Foods can cause higher or lower levels of allergens. High-quality food can also prevent many health problems in cats. Feed only the amounts recommended by your veterinarian, keeping treat consumption in mind. Keeping a Munchkin cat at the proper weight is one of the easiest ways to protect its overall health. If your cat is overweight, dieting may be necessary.</p>
<h3>PET INSURANCE FOR OUR MUNCHKIN KITTENS FOR SALE.</h3>
<P>Insurance for purebred Munchkin cats costs more than insurance for mixed breed Munchkin cats. This is because a purebred Munchkin cat is more likely than a mixed breed Munchkin cat to file claims for hereditary diseases, which are expensive to treat. We include pet insurance plans for our Munchkin cats for sale, and provide full coverage for all Munchkin kittens for the adoption-specific conditions (except those already present) to which purebred Munchkin cats are prone. The best time to purchase insurance for your Munchkin cat is when it is a healthy Munchkin kitten.

    You can't predict what will happen in the future, and pet insurance is the one thing you can't have when you need it most. Munchkin kitten health insurance is administered by Embrace Pet Insurance Agency, LLC and underwritten by one of the licensed insurers of American Modern Insurance Group, Inc. including American Modern Home Insurance Company d/b/a in NC as American Modern Insurance Company (Lic. No 2222-8), and American Southern Home Insurance Company. Coverage is subject to terms, conditions, limitations, exclusions, underwriter review and approval and may not be available for all risks or in all states. Rates and discounts vary, are determined by many factors and are subject to change.
